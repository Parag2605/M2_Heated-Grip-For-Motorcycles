# Introduction
Now-days everyone is looking for automation and advancements in all the sectors. The Heated Grip For Motorcycles System is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles Handlebars. In European countries, the temperature is very low and any electronic designer should make sure that his equipment should work efficiently in that whether. 

When rider of the motorcycle rides the motorcycle, the button sensor gets trigger after that heater empowered. The temperature sensor keeps monitoring the temperature and sends analog value of temperature to the microcontroller. The microcontroller alters analog to digital values using ADC and show the numerical value of temperature.

Based on the controller it will set the temperature and it is capable of upholding of heat in the vehicles seats. And whatever the warmness is generated that fact it will be showing on displays.

# Features
- The System will sense is rider is riding or not.
- Rider has the access to modify the temperature in the vehicle grips.
- As per Riders request, Heater will generate the heat accordingly.
- Low cost and robust system.

## Strenghts
- User Friendly
- Easy to alter the temperature on the handlebar.
- Low cost and Robust system.

## Weakness
- Its only applicable for those countries which are having low temperature and on hilly areas.

## Opportunities
- It can be implemented on any of the motorcycles.

## Threats
- Not suitable for average or high temperature places.

# 4'W and 1'H
- WHY - Well-being for user.

- WHAT - Heated Grip For Motorcycles System.

- WHEN - Winter seasons and according to user.

- WHERE - Used in Motorcycles.

- HOW - Operates by Temperature Sensor and Microcontroller.
